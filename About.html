    Hello, my name is Junho Lee.<br>
    I know a lot of people are suffering and scared due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus).<br>
    Also, I heard a lot of shocking and desperate news such as many people getting rejected from hospitals.<br>
    Unfortunately, there are not many places in the US you can go to seek treatment for this virus due to the lack of <br>
    equipment and facilities.<br>
    <br>
    Since I am not on the frontlines alongside doctors, nurses, or any other essential medical workers <br> 
    who are fighting against covid-19 I can't help you directly. <br>
    However, I still wanted to help people, so I decided to create this website/application.<br>
    With this, I wish people can be better prepared and know where to go to when they start <br>
    to experience symptoms of the coronavirus at least.<br>
    "COVID-19 Testing Locations Map" allows you to find a testing location for the coronavirus very quickly. <br>
    <br>I will keep everything such as the UI in this website as simple as possible so everyone can use it directly without any difficulty.<br>
    
    
    
    <br>Thank you and stay healthy!<br>
